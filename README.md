Learning notes on fundamentals of retrieval augmented generation.

## Large Language Model (LLM)

## LLM Generation Challenges
- Limited with data they are trained on
- Hard to adapt
- Answer does not have source
- Answer is out of date and changes over time
- Data is specific to business

## Vector Database
- Mathematical representation of strucutured and unstructured data similar to an array
- Query vector database, we get back embeddings which includes relevant data, merged into the original prompt and fed into LLM 
- As new data comes in, vector embeddings gets updated

## Vector 
An array of data that gets stored into database in numerical form.

## Embeddings
A multi demensional representation of vector data.

## AI Agents
Enables compound AI system by combining LLM models and independent modules to answer a user query.

## Worries and concerns
- Taking orders, processing refunds
- Hallucinations
- Inaccurate results
- Perpetuate bias
