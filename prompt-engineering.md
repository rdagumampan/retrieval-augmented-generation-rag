## Prompt Engineering Techniques
1. RAG
2. COT
3. ReACT
4. DSP

## RAG
- Rerieval Augmented Generation
- Brings awareness of knowledge base into LLM
- Retriever brings context into LLM (ex. search vector database)
- Generator which uses the context and prepare human friendly responses

## COT
- Change Of Thought
- Taking big task and breaking it down into multiple sections
- Example, instead of answering right away like total earnings, using COT we break down to earnings in each business unit and sum up
- Enables LLM to arrive at better answer using reasoning and logic
- Allows LLM answer to be explainable and transparent

## ReACT
- Repeatable Retrieve Action
- Brings public information
- Example, consider all financial reports of listed company is public but latest one is private

## DSP
- Directional Stimulus Prompting
- Using hints to get more accurate answers
- Example, you want to ask for annual earnings but give specific year to report on
